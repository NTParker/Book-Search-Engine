# Book Search Engine 

This application is a Google Books API search engine that allows user to create an account and save books. The user can then view their saved books on a seperate page for future reference. The app initially used a RESTful API which I converted to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
